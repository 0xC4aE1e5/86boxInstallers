# THIS VIOLATES THE GPL!

The reason is because it bundles the ROMs which have a different license.

## Instructions

All that you have to do is this:

1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Click the latest release that was built successfully.
3. Download the artifact you would like.

Notes:

1. For some reason Windows Defender detects these installers as malicious software. This is a false positive.
2. This might be out of date. It uploads on the 15th of every day (in UTC).
